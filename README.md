a bouncing midi pattern generator

A basic but fun take on Tenori-On Bounce Mode, put together as an overdue exercise in teach-yourself-monome. Requires monomeserial set to /osc. Should be good for 40h, 64s, 128s & 256s, plus has virtual interface for monome-less operation. MIDI output only, and noteouts are adjustable from 0 to 127. Loads of fun with Ableton>Impulse (syncs to external host) and plays nicely in Max Runtime.
